# SimpleGUI/Tkinter Converter (STconverter) is a little software which will 
# convert Python scripts written for the online SimpleGUI interface to work 
# instead with Tkinter on your computer. 
# 
# "Tkinter is Python's de-facto standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) package"
# (http://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter)
# "SimpleGUI is a custom Python graphical user interface (GUI) module implemented 
# directly in CodeSkulptor that provides an easy to learn interface for building 
# interactive programs in Python" (http://www.codeskulptor.org) used for the 
# online Coursera course "An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python" 
# by Joe Warren, Scott Rixner, John Greiner, and Stephen Wong (Rice University) 
# 
# Online version: 
# Stconverter Online is the webapp version of STconverter and can be find at 
# http://stconverter-online.appspot.com/
# 
# For the latest version of STconverter, you can visit the repository on Github:

2. REQUIREMENTS

2.1. To run STconverter

- Python & Tkinter: STconverter will need Python installed on your machine with 
the Tkinter module (generally installed by default with Python) to run correctly.
http://www.python.org/download/


2.2. To run your program (after conversion) on your machine

A simple rule of thumb is:
				Additional module(s)	Works with Python
your program is simple		/			2.7 or 3
your program has music		pygame			2.7 or 3
your program has image		PIL			2.7 only

- Music: if your SimpleGUI program plays music, you will need in addition to have 
pygame installed on your machine to run your program (but is not required for the 
conversion)
http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml

- Image: if your SimpleGUI program displays images, you will need in addition to 
have the Python Imaging Library (PIL) with the ImageTk module installed on your 
machine to run your program (but are not required for the conversion).
Unfortunately, so far, PIL is not available for Python 3 and works only for 
Python 2.2 to 2.7.

3. INSTALLATION

No installation of STconversion required. Just download the STconverter.py file, 
and it's ready to use.



4. HOW TO USE

On linux, you can start the program by typing in terminal:

	./Path_To_The_Directory_Where_It_Is_Located/STconverter.py

or if STconverter is already in your current folder:

	./STconverter.py

The GUI will then start. 



5. MAJOR KNOWN ISSUES

> Global Variables:
SimpleGUI handles very well global variables which were assigned "locally" 
in a function. This is generally not the case of your Python interpreter. 

> Multiline Expressions: 
although STconverter can handle multiline SimpleGUI expressions (as for 
example a canvas.draw_polyline() written in multiline), sometimes it can 
cause problems during the conversion. 
If it is the case, try to write the parameters in variables before:
	canvas.draw_polyline([(CANVAS_SIZE[0] // 3, CANVAS_SIZE[1] // 3), 
        	              (POINT_POS[0] * 2, POINT_POS[1] * 2), 
                	      (POINT_POS[0] * 3, POINT_POS[1] * 3)], 
                	      12, "Blue")
will become:
	points = [(CANVAS_SIZE[0] // 3, CANVAS_SIZE[1] // 3), 
        	  (POINT_POS[0] * 2, POINT_POS[1] * 2), 
          	  (POINT_POS[0] * 3, POINT_POS[1] * 3)]
	canvas.draw_polyline(points, 12, "Blue")

> Comments: 
Comments written inside multiline SimpleGUI expressions are not supported yet. 
(however, comments written at the end of such expressions is not an issue)

> Canvas background color: 
the color of the canvas background cannot be changed once the program started.

> Divisions and Canvas texts: 
Division on Python 2.7 returns the floor of the quotient, whereas on Python 3 
and SimpleGUI it returns the true division result. In order to make divisions 
behave like in SimpleGUI, the converted file by default includes a "from 
__future__ import division" statement. 
As a result, text messages printed on Canvas containing division results will 
show float numbers which could disrupt the formating. In this case, if true 
division is not needed, you could remove the division statement from the 
converted file, or if true division is needed, you could print the integer of 
the division result. 



6. TESTED ON...

So far, it has been tested on:
- Linux with Python 2.7.3, pygame 1.9.1, and PIL 1.1.7
