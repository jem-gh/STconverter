# SimpleGUI/Tkinter Converter (STconverter.py) is a little software aiming to 
# convert simple Python scripts written for SimpleGUI to work with Tkinter GUI 
# module instead (and in the future, vice versa).

1. REQUIREMENTS

- Python & Tkinter: STconverter will need Python installed on your machine with 
the Tkinter module (generally installed by default with Python) to run correctly.
http://www.python.org/download/

- Music: if your SimpleGUI program plays music, you will need in addition to have 
pygame installed on your machine to run your program (but is not required for the 
conversion)
http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml

- Image: if your SimpleGUI program displays images, you will need in addition to 
have the Python Imaging Library (PIL) with the ImageTk module installed on your 
machine to run your program (but are not required for the conversion).
Unfortunately, so far, PIL is not available for Python 3 and works only for 
Python 2.2 to 2.7.

2. STconverter INSTALLATION

No installation of STconversion required. Just download the STconverter.py file, 
and it's ready to use.



3. HOW TO USE

On linux, you can start the program by clicking on the STconverter.py file or 
by typing in terminal:

	./Path_To_The_Directory_Where_It_Is_Located/STconverter.py

The GUI will then start. 



4. TESTED ON... AND KNOWN ISSUES

So far, it has been tested on:
- Linux with Python 2.7.3, pygame 1.9.1, and PIL 1.1.7

Unfortunately, the converted program won't work with Python 3 if it uses 
images, as it requires the Python Imaging Library (PIL).
