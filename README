# SimpleGUI/Tkinter Converter (STconverter) is a little software aiming to 
# convert Python scripts written for SimpleGUI to work with Tkinter GUI instead.
# 
# "Tkinter is Python's de-facto standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) package"
# (http://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter)
# "SimpleGUI is a custom Python graphical user interface (GUI) module implemented 
# directly in CodeSkulptor that provides an easy to learn interface for building 
# interactive programs in Python" (http://www.codeskulptor.org) used for the 
# online Coursera course "An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python" 
# by Joe Warren, Scott Rixner, John Greiner, and Stephen Wong (Rice University) 
# 
# For the latest version of STConverter visit the repository on Github:

# 
# STconverter is developed by Jean-Etienne Morlighem

1. REQUIREMENTS

1.1. To run STconverter

- Python & Tkinter: STconverter will need Python installed on your machine with 
the Tkinter module (generally installed by default with Python) to run correctly.
http://www.python.org/download/


1.2. To run your program on your machine once converted

A simple rule of thumb is:
			Additional module(s)	Works with Python
program			/			2.7 or 3
program with music	pygame			2.7 or 3
program with image	PIL			2.7 only

- Music: if your SimpleGUI program plays music, you will need in addition to have 
pygame installed on your machine to run your program (but is not required for the 
conversion)
http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml

- Image: if your SimpleGUI program displays images, you will need in addition to 
have the Python Imaging Library (PIL) with the ImageTk module installed on your 
machine to run your program (but are not required for the conversion).
Unfortunately, so far, PIL is not available for Python 3 and works only for 
Python 2.2 to 2.7.

2. STconverter INSTALLATION

No installation of STconversion required. Just download the STconverter.py file, 
and it's ready to use.



3. HOW TO USE

On linux, you can start the program by clicking on the STconverter.py file or 
by typing in terminal:

	./Path_To_The_Directory_Where_It_Is_Located/STconverter.py

or if STconverter is in your current folder:

	./STconverter.py

The GUI will then start. 



4. MAJOR KNOWN ISSUES

- Global Variables: SimpleGUI handles very well global variables which were 
assigned "locally" in a function. 

- Comments written inside multiline SimpleGUI expressions (as for example a 
canvas.draw_polyline() written in multiline) are not supported. (however, 
comments written at the end of such expressions is not an issue)



5. TESTED ON...

So far, it has been tested on:
- Linux with Python 2.7.3, pygame 1.9.1, and PIL 1.1.7
